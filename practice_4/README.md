# Practice 4 - Global planner

In this practice, we will be using a map. Map is in [Lanelet2](https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/Lanelet2) format. Your task will be to write a global planner that finds the shortest route from the vehicle's current location to the goal point. The path should then be converted to a `Path` message so that the `pure_pursuit_follower`, a node you wrote in the previous practice, could use it for path following.


#### Additional files provided
   - [launch/practice_4.launch](launch/practice_4.launch) - a launch file that should run without errors at the end of the practice
   - [rviz/practice_4.rviz](rviz/practice_4.rviz) - RViz config file for visualizing the topics.

### Expected outcome
* General level understanding of the global planner tasks
* The car can follow a path created by the global planner (from the ego vehicle's current location to the selected destination on the map)


## 1. Create a global planner node and get the goal point

This node will make it possible to plan a path on the map. So, instead of loading the path from the waypoints file, we can select any destination on the map, and the global planner will create the path from the current location to the selected goal point.

##### Instructions
1. Create a new file, `lanelet2_global_planner.py` under `nodes/planning/global`
2. When creating the node, follow the class-based structure (you can take hints from previous practice or other provided nodes)
3. Add the code for lanelet2 map loading; you can use the code from `src/autoware_mini/lanelet2.py` in `autoware_mini` package as an example
   - Import necessary classes from the lanelet2 library
   - read in the necessary ROS parameters from `localization.yaml` (see the function parameters in example code) and `lanelet2_map_path` coming from the launch file
   - Add the code that loads the lanelet2 map

```
# All these imports from lanelet2 library should be sufficient
import lanelet2
from lanelet2.io import Origin, load
from lanelet2.projection import UtmProjector
from lanelet2.core import BasicPoint2d
from lanelet2.geometry import findNearest
```

4. Create a subscriber and a callback to get the goal point. Goal point will be entered on the map using a button in RViz with a purple arrow: `2D Nav Goal`
   - The goal point is published to a topic: `/move_base_simple/goal`, type: `geometry_msgs/PoseStamped`
   - Add a [loginfo](https://wiki.ros.org/rospy_tutorials/Tutorials/Logging) message informing us that the goal point has been received. 
   - It is good practice to start with the node name that creates the log, and it might be helpful to print out also the coordinates, for example:

```
# loginfo message about receiving the goal point
rospy.loginfo("%s - goal position (%f, %f, %f) orientation (%f, %f, %f, %f) in %s frame", rospy.get_name(),
                    msg.pose.position.x, msg.pose.position.y, msg.pose.position.z,
                    msg.pose.orientation.x, msg.pose.orientation.y, msg.pose.orientation.z,
                    msg.pose.orientation.w, msg.header.frame_id)

```


##### Validation
* run `roslaunch autoware_mini_practice_solutions practice_4.launch`
* It should start at the same location and with the map loaded, but the ego vehicle should stay stopped.
* Test also by adding the goal point - purple arrow with `2D Nav Goal` written next to it. You should have the message about receiving the goal printed out in the console.

Output loginfo messages:
```
[INFO] [1707312819.916352]: /lanelet2_global_planner - goal position (-1.027190, -40.500565, 0.000000) orientation (0.000000, 0.000000, -0.760734, 0.649064) in map frame
[INFO] [1707312907.073692]: /lanelet2_global_planner - goal position (4.622345, -35.071140, 0.000000) orientation (0.000000, 0.000000, 0.619234, 0.785206) in map frame
```


## 2. Find the route on the lanelet2 map

Next, we will implement the logic of creating the global plan (path from start to goal point). We need the current pose and goal point to be available.

To find a route with the lanelet2 library, traffic rules object and routing graph need to be created first - [see example here](https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/Lanelet2/blob/master/lanelet2_examples/scripts/tutorial.py#L215). For a more thorough overview about [lanelet2 routing](https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/Lanelet2/tree/master/lanelet2_routing). 

The following code can be used to create the necessary objects for routing:

```
# traffic rules
traffic_rules = lanelet2.traffic_rules.create(lanelet2.traffic_rules.Locations.Germany,
                                          lanelet2.traffic_rules.Participants.VehicleTaxi)
# routing graph
self.graph = lanelet2.routing.RoutingGraph(self.lanelet2_map, traffic_rules)
```

##### Instructions
1. Generate traffic rules and routing graph
2. Create the subscriber to the `/localization/current_pose` message, type: `geometry_msgs/PoseStamped`
3. Convert current_pose and goal point to lanelet2 geometry type of `BasicPoint2d`

```
self.current_location = BasicPoint2d(msg.pose.position.x, msg.pose.position.y)
```

4. `findNearest()` from lanelet2.geometry can be used to find lanelets closest to points (current pose or goal); see code below.
5. `getRoute()`, `shortestPath()` and `getRemainingLane()` from lanelet2 python api routing part will be useful.

```
# get start and end lanelets
start_lanelet = findNearest(self.lanelet2_map.laneletLayer, self.current_location, 1)[0][1]
goal_lanelet = findNearest(self.lanelet2_map.laneletLayer, self.goal_point, 1)[0][1]
# find routing graph
route = self.graph.getRoute(start_lanelet, goal_lanelet, 0, True)

# find shortest path
path = route.shortestPath()
# This returns LaneletSequence to a point where a lane change would be necessary to continue
path_no_lane_change = path.getRemainingLane(start_lanelet)
```

6. If no route has been found after entering the goal point, return None and add a warning message `logwarn`
7. Add a printout for the `path_no_lane_change`

##### Validation
* run `roslaunch autoware_mini_practice_solutions practice_4.launch`
* Try to add a goal point where it is impossible to reach and see your warning message in the console
* Place a goal point near the ego vehicle start location, and if the route has been found, a LaneletSequence should be printed out in the console. See example below:

```
LaneletSequence([ConstLanelet(403, ConstLineString3d(5005287, [ConstPoint3d(10001311, 2.94416, 11.6655, 34.53), ConstPoint3d(10018228, 2.2844, 8.62274, 34.5425), ConstPoint3d(10018229, 1.64092, 4.13419, 34.52), ConstPoint3d(10001314, 0.680376, -2.76998, 34.4925)], AttributeMap({'type': 'virtual'})), ConstLineString3d(5008181, [ConstPoint3d(10001313, -0.469599, 12.4217, 34.7094), ConstPoint3d(10035882, -0.493074, 12.2516, 34.7094), ConstPoint3d(10035883, -1.72435, 3.33124, 34.58), ConstPoint3d(10001316, -2.52863, -2.32171, 34.5919)], AttributeMap({'type': 'curbstone'})), AttributeMap({'location': 'urban', 'one_way': 'yes', 'speed_limit ': '50', 'speed_ref': '14', 'subtype': 'road', 'turn_direction': 'straight', 'type': 'lanelet'})), ConstLanelet(635, ConstLineString3d(5006813, [ConstPoint3d(10001314, 0.680376, -2.76998, 34.4925), ConstPoint3d(10030250, 0.585444, -4.42386, 34.4906), ConstPoint3d(10030251, 0.670187, -6.25323, 34.4675), ConstPoint3d(10030252, 0.882086, -7.93378, 34.4056), ConstPoint3d(10030253, 1.50244, -11.5438, 34.3812), ConstPoint3d(10030254, 1.9042, -13.8817, 34.3638), ConstPoint3d(10030255, 2.16653, -15.6485, 34.3481), ConstPoint3d(10030256, 2.32317, -18.046, 34.3662), ConstPoint3d(10030257, 2.32041, -20.4684, 34.3575), ConstPoint3d(10001300, 2.39995, -20.656, 34.3575)], AttributeMap({'type': 'virtual'})), ConstLineString3d(5008182, [ConstPoint3d(10001316, -2.52863, -2.32171, 34.5919), ConstPoint3d(10035884, -2.64504, -3.13996, 34.5913), ConstPoint3d(10035885, -2.65793, -3.23052, 34.5913), ConstPoint3d(10035886, -2.9109, -5.6337, 34.5744), ConstPoint3d(10035887, -2.5264, -10.0436, 34.57), ConstPoint3d(10035888, -1.69238, -18.0843, 34.4), ConstPoint3d(10001302, -1.32892, -20.1109, 34.4162)], AttributeMap({'type': 'curbstone'})), AttributeMap({'location': 'urban', 'one_way': 'yes', 'speed_limit ': '50', 'speed_ref': '22', 'subtype': 'road', 'turn_direction': 'left', 'type': 'lanelet'}))])

```



## 3. Convert lanelets to a path

We now have a route (`path_no_lane_change` from code example) that consists of lanelets (LaneletSequence), but we need to convert it to message type `autoware_mini/Path` and publish it to a topic `global_path`, so the `pure_pursuit_follower` would be able to subscribe to it and do its job (path following).

##### Instructions
1. Create a separate function that converts a lanelet sequence to waypoints
2. Previously acquired LaneletSequence (`path_no_lane_change`) is iterable, so use a for loop to go over it and get the individual lanelets
3. Check if lanelets have the attribute `speed_ref`; if yes, use it for waypoint speed.
   - `speed_ref` is in **km/h**, but Waypoint message needs it in  **m/s**
   - Add a parameter `speed_limit` to a launch file with a 40km/h default value. None of the waypoint speeds in the path should exceed it!
   - If lanelet does not have the `speed_ref`, then `speed_limit` should be used for its waypoints.

```
# code to check if lanelet has attribute speed_ref
if 'speed_ref' in lanelet.attributes:
    speed = float(lanelet.attributes['speed_ref'])
```

4. Waypoints should be extracted from `lanelet.centerline` (again, it is iterable and gives you points where coordinates can be accessed with point.x, point.y, etc.).
Hint: The end point of a lanelet and the start point of the following lanelet overlap - there should be no overlapping waypoints in the output path

```
# create Waypoint (from autoware_mini.msgs import Waypoint) and get the coordinats from lanelet.centerline points
waypoint = Waypoint()
waypoint.position.x = point.x
waypoint.position.y = point.y
waypoint.position.z = point.z
waypoint.speed = speed
```

5. Create a publisher and publish waypoints into the topic `global_path`; it should be [latched topic](https://wiki.ros.org/rospy/Overview/Publishers%20and%20Subscribers#rospy.Publisher_initialization). 
   - Create a special function for waypoint publishing that is called within the callback (after the lanelet sequence has been converted to waypoints). It makes the code more modular and has a better overview, and we might need to call it from another callback, as we will see later.
   - `global_path` should be type autoware_mini/Path, and its attribute `waypoints` is the list of Waypoints.
   - `frame_id` should come from `config/planning.yaml` file, parameter `output_frame`
   - The timestamp should be added

```
path = Path()        
path.header.frame_id = self.output_frame
path.header.stamp = rospy.Time.now()
path.waypoints = waypoints
self.waypoints_pub.publish(path)
```

##### Validation
* run `roslaunch autoware_mini_practice_solutions practice_4.launch lanelet2_map_name:=tartu_large.osm`
* Everything should run without errors.
* run `rqt_graph`; nodes should now be connected like this:

![node_graph_task](images/rqt_graph_task4.png)

* run `roslaunch autoware_mini_practice_solutions practice_4.launch lanelet2_map_name:=tartu_large.osm` with additional argument of `speed_limit:=10`. Verify that the planned route does not exceed the specified velocity. You can echo the `/localization/current_velocity` topic.
* See what happens when the ego vehicle reaches the end of the path.

![ego_continues_driving](images/ego_continues_driving.png)



## 4. Clear the path when the goal has been reached

As we saw at the end of the previous task, the ego vehicle continued to drive with some chaotic behaviour after reaching the end of the path. Additionally, the path is kept even though we have reached the destination. In this task, you should add functionality that will clear the path (publish an empty path) once the destination has been reached.

Publishing an empty path will cause problems for the follower, so you will need to update it.

##### Instructions

1. There is a parameter in planning.yaml called `distance_to_goal_limit` - add getting it to the node.
2. Use it to clear the path (publish an empty path - empty list of waypoints) when the car is within that distance of the goal point.
   - Choose the correct callback to place it.
   - Assumes that the goal point is stored
3. Add a loginfo message that the goal has been reached when it happens, and the path has been cleared.
4. run `roslaunch autoware_mini_practice_solutions practice_4.launch lanelet2_map_name:=tartu_large.osm` - see what happens when the goal has been reached - observe the console output.
   - Make sure that your follower can handle an empty path message if it couldn't previously
   - When an empty path is received, you need to stop the car, and the only option is to use `vehicle_cmd`
   - What should be published to the vehicle_cmd that will make a vehicle come to a stop?

##### Validation
* run `roslaunch autoware_mini_practice_solutions practice_4.launch lanelet2_map_name:=tartu_large.osm`
* Everything should run without errors.
* When the car approaches the end of the path, there should be a log info message (goal reached), and the path should be cleared, and the vehicle should gradually come to a complete stop. It can't stop immediately because there are deceleration limits in the `bicycle_simulator`, so it will still drive past the goal point. Stopping at the correct place just before the path ends will be solved in the local planner.



## 5. One more thing

You may have noticed that the path end and goal point are not in sync. The problem starts when we use `findNearest()` to get the closest lanelet to the goal point. It returns the whole lanelet, and if the goal point is somewhere in the middle of the lanelet, then that is where the discrepancy comes from. 

The following example illustrates the issue:
* run: `roslaunch autoware_mini_practice_solutions practice_4.launch lanelet2_map_name:=tartu_large.osm`
   - Set the start location
   - Set the goal point
   - Observe how the path is drawn and when it is cleared

![path_vs_goal](images/path_vs_goal.png)

* We want to have the path end and goal point in the exact same location, because
   - Later, when the local planner takes care of stopping at the path end, it does not have the information about the user-selected goal point, so for the local planner, the goal point is at the end of the path (last waypoint)
   - The global planner knows the goal point entered by the user and uses this for the path end check. And that is the source of confusion.

This needs to be solved - we need to sync them. 

##### Instructions

Find your solution to the problem. The solution is valid if the last waypoint of the path and the goal point are aligned (are in the same location). This means that you might need to alter the goal point or path endpoint locations (coordinates).

Three ideas that might help:
1. The most straightforward solution is to accept that a full lanelet is added to the path and use the last waypoint from there to overwrite the goal point.
2. Use the closest waypoint to a goal point as the path end and use it also for resetting the goal point location.
3. Create a new waypoint - the closest point on the path to the user-selected goal point (shapely project and interpolate can be used) and use that as the path end and goal point.


##### Validation
* Test your solution and verify that it works!
* Clean the code, add comments, think about the readability of the code, and pay attention to formatting
* When finished, please create `practice_4_solution.txt` file in the root directory of your repo containing a small description of your solution to the last task.
