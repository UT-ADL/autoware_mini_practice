# Practice 8 - CARLA simulator

# TODO!

Initial idea for this practice is to obtain a set of several route scenarios in CARLA focused on the demo loop and let students drive through them. The results of the driving should be recorded and sent to the instructors together with the metrics of the every route scenario. The metrics should include: collisions, time of the lap, compliance with traffic lights, etc. The best results get a prize?
